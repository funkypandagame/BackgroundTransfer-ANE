#Background Transfer - Adobe AIR Native Extension for iOS

This [AIR Native Extension](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/native-extensions-for-air.html) provides AS3 API to use [iOS Background Transfer Service](http://www.appcoda.com/background-transfer-service-ios7/) for downloading files in Adobe AIR application.

Starting from iOS7, with Background Transfer Service:

 - downloads and uploads are managed by iOS;                                                                          
 - the transfer continues even when the user sends the app to the background (e.g. switches to another app);
 - there's no time limit for download/upload;
 - if the app crashes during the download/upload, the retransmission will start automatically when the app is launched;

## Usage

Initialize `BackgroundTransfer` object:

```   
BackgroundTransfer.instance.initializeSession(SESSION_ID);

downloadTask = BackgroundTransfer.instance.createDownloadTask(sessionID, remoteURL, localPath);
downloadTask.addEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, onDownloadTaskProgress, false, 0, true);
downloadTask.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onDownloadTaskCompleted, false, 0, true);
downloadTask.addEventListener(ErrorEvent.ERROR, onDownloadTaskError, false, 0, true);
downloadTask.resume();

```

To continue download tasks that were interrupted (for instance, due to app crash) implement initialization event:

```
BackgroundTransfer.instance.addEventListener(BTSessionInitializedEvent.INITIALIZED, onBackgroundSessionInitialized, false, 0, true);

private function onBackgroundSessionInitialized(event:BTSessionInitializedEvent):void {
    for each (var runningTask:BTDownloadTask in event.runningTasks) {
        // continue tasks
    }
}
```

Run the demo project for more implementation details.

## Limitations

Upload tasks are not supported and currently I'm not working on it. Pull requests are welcome :).
There's no support for Android platform.

## Building

Requirements â€“ Adobe Air SDK 4.0 or later, Xcode, iOS SDK 7.0 or later

Add the `FlashRuntimeExtensions.h` file from the Adobe AIR SDK to the `ios/BackgroundTransferANE/BackgroundTransferANE` folder in the project.
Update the `build/ant-build.config` file in the build folder to match your Adobe AIR SDK setup.
Run the ant build script `ant-build.xml`. This will compile and package the ANE. Binary files will be saved into `bin/` folder.

##License

Default (not native) implementation of this ANE uses GreenSock LoaderMax for downloading files. `greensock.swc` library is subject to its own license. Please follow [https://greensock.com/licensing/]() for more details.
